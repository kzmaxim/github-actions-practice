GitHub Actions Practice


This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to automatically run a Python script (main.py) whenever a push is made to the repository. The workflow file is defined in .github/workflows/run-pyscript.yml and runs on the ubuntu-latest environment.

Project Overview
Python Script: The project contains a simple Python script (main.py) that outputs a custom message to the log.
GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions is configured to automatically run the script on every push event.
Files
main.py: The Python script that prints a message to the log.
run-pyscript.yml: The GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the process of running main.py.
How It Works
GitHub Actions Setup: The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/run-pyscript.yml. When a push is made to the repository, the following steps occur:

GitHub Actions checks out the repository.
The Python environment is set up.
If a requirements.txt file is present, dependencies are installed (this step can be skipped if there are no dependencies).
The main.py script is executed, and the output is logged.
Trigger:

The workflow is triggered every time a push is made to the repository.
Running the Workflow
To run the workflow:

Make a commit and push changes to the main branch.
The workflow will automatically start and execute the main.py script.
You can view the logs for each workflow run by navigating to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.

Example Output
The output of the Python script will be visible in the workflow logs under the Actions tab. A sample output might look like this:

vbnet
Copy code
This is my custom message printed from the Python script.
Requirements
Python 3.x: The workflow uses Python 3, which is automatically set up in the GitHub Actions environment.
GitHub Actions: The repository uses GitHub Actions for automation, so no additional setup is needed locally.
